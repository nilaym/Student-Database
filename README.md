Student-Database
================

A Java simulation of a grading portal for a school.

I started this project to gain experience with the swing and AWT libraries in Java.

It includes both a "student portal" and "teacher portal". Running the teacher portal file will allow you to create
create students and input test grades whereas running the student portal will require you to log in as a hypothetical
student and will only allow you to view that students' grades.
